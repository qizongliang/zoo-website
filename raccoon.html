        The raccoon is commonly called trash panda. They are called such since raccoons thrive in the trash bin of most cities. They also take shelter on the roof of the human house and eat leftover food from the trash bin. Although they look very innocent and cute.
         They are not meant to be domesticated, since they are often carriers of diseases such as rabies which are dangerous to the health of humans. 
         However, these cute furry animals are still supporting the mental health of many people. We often make posts of these cute raccoons with a 
         relatable white text inside these images. Those images may also be edited to make it look funny as a way to express love and humor. Overall 
         this may be one of the cutest animals due to their innocent looking beady eyes and their cute paws. Their fur patterns also add to their cuteness, 
         since the dark circle around their eye makes them look like they havenâ€™t slept in days, which is why people often make fun of them for not sleeping in
          during the night.
