      The raccoon is commonly called trash panda they are called such since raccoon are thriving in the trash bin of most cities. They also take shelter in the roof of human house and eat 
      left over food from the trash bin. Although they look very innocent and cute. They are not domesticatable animal for human since they are often carrier
      of diseases such as rabies. However, these cute furry animal are still supporting the mental health of many people. We often make post of these cute raccoon with
      a relatedable white text inside these images. Those images may also be editied to make it look funnier. Overall this may be one of the cuttest animal due to their
      innocent looking beadly eye and their cute paws that mimics human grabbing item. Which are the reason why these animal are enjoyed in memes all over the world.
