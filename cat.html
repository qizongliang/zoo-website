        The cat is an obligate carnivore that survives off hunting smaller prey, they are solitary hunters.
        However modern day house cat discard the need for hunt and have invented a new skill set, which is to meow loudly to call upon their owner's attention
        for needs. Cats will meow loudly in demanding their basic needs and as well as expressing their emotional distress much like an infant cat that calls upon their mother.
        Modern day house cat are also scared of cucumber that is placed unexpectedly behind them, a funny prank to play
        on a house cat by their owner, They will react by jumping off the ground.
